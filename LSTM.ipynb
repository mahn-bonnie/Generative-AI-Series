            "﻿Adam Ferguson sensed the moment was right: \"Everyone was simply waiting but there was an air of suspense, too, with people lo oking off in different directions. I made the decision, on the spot, that this was going to be it.\" Spanning four complete pages inside Sunday's special section, \"The Road to Nowhere,\" is a single photograph, shot by Mr. Fergus on, depicting about 100 people waiting in line at a food distribution center outside Diffa, Niger. Each of the picture's subjec ts had fled from a series of horrors, landing in one of the many makeshift settlements scattered alongside National Route 1, a stretch of truncated highway that is now one of the only places in the region to offer refuge from the terrorist group Boko Har am. How did the 47-by-20-inch photograph, one of the largest if not the largest images ever published in The New York Times, co me together? \"With great difficulty, is the short answer,\" Mr. Ferguson said. The Australian photographer was sent to Niger's Route 1 with a specific assignment: Capture a photograph that could be used in a special layout called a \"pano-8\" which, as readers of Sunday's paper will see, unfolds to showcase a four-page spread. (The Times has employed the layout on only three previous occasions for journalistic projects.) Makini Schools 100 BCLB number: The aim was to use a large annotated photograph both to convey the scale of the crisis and to humanize those in its grip. \"By attaching names, ages, locations and personal stories and details, we hope a reader can really start to connect with those people beyond a one-line caption that would normally accompany an image,\" said Larry Buchanan, a graphics editor at The Times w ho, along with David Furst, The Times's international photo editor, helped conceive and direct the project. \"Logistically, the assignment was an incredible challenge,\" Mr. Furst said. \"What Adam pulled off was a remarkable feat of jour nalism.\" In the end, it took two separate trips to Niger and almost two weeks on the ground before Mr. Ferguson captured an appropriatel y arresting image that also satisfied the compositional requirements: a scene showing a large crowd, with enough empty space at the top and bottom to display personal stories. But shooting the photograph was just the beginning. Mr. Ferguson then set to wo rk identifying the subjects and conducting interviews which, given the fleeting circumstances of the food line, proved staggeri ngly difficult.\n"
